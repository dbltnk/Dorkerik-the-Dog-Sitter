IDEAS!
- Doggy playground slots outside (additional 'spots')
- You can add rooms
- You can decorate and customise your daycare decor
- You can share your doggy daycare with a friend so they can see it - beautiful furniture 
- Special event doggies that few people can buy
- Mystery doggies at higher levels
- Most doggies are weens BUT SOMETIMES you can buy a pug if you're lucky
- Sell snacks that the people can buy to feed to the dogs (deputise the people to feed the dogs) 
- Buy a special coffee selling point
- Coffee for sale for the people to drink, if they drink the coffee they stay longer and feed more dogs
- You can buy tools like the pooper scooper
- You can hire employees (or robots) that serve the people drinks 
- You can buy a special dog poop roomba that scoops the poop
- Buy a social media spot where they can pose with the dogs (go there, they show a specific dog icon, then you bring the dog over so they can take a photo with the dog)
- If they do this, you make more money and more people come
- Think about mechanisms for attracting more people
